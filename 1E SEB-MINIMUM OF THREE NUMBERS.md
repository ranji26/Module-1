# Experiment No: 1e â€“ SEB-Maximum of Three Numbers

## AIM  
To write a Python program to find the maximum between three integer numbers using a conditional expression (Ternary operator).

## ALGORITHM  
1.Start the program.
2.Take three float inputs: a, b, and c.
3.Use nested conditional expressions (ternary operator):
4.First check: a > b and a > c, then a is maximum.
5.Else, check b > c, then b is maximum.
6.Otherwise, c is maximum.
7.Store the result in a variable max_num.
8.Display the result.
9.End the program.
## PROGRAM
a=float(input()) <br>
b=float(input()) <br>
c=float(input()) <br>
if a>b and a>c:   <br>
    print(f"The maximum of {a}, {b}, {c} is {a}")   <br>
elif (b>c):  <br>
    print(f"The maximum of {a}, {b}, {c} is {b}")  <br>
else:   <br>
    print(f"The maximum of {a}, {b}, {c} is {c}")  <br>
